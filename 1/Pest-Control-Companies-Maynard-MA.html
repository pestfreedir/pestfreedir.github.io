<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound techniques as well as its selection of inherent strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or saving natural enemy populations by providing havens or preventing practices that hurt them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
