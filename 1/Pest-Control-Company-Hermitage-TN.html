<p>Socio-psychological aspects including rational and moral factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of qualified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry contaminants in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
