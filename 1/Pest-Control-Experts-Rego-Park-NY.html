It is a term that describes the method which growers cultivate and safeguard their crops based on a knowledge of cycles around plants, of equilibriums and relationships of dependence in between plants, insects, micro-organisms and nutrients.</p>
<p>For example, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more each week while a pesticide application usually requires the use of tractor when every 7-14 d.

IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in truth need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the active ingredients or packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>

We typically suggest pest control chemicals that do the job utilizing the least amount of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last resort). These prevention and control strategies consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, hereditary, chemical, and regulatory methods.</p>
