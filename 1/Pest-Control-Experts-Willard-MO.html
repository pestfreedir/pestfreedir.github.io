<p>Thank you for picking RID Pest Control to protect your house from termites. In Asia, various stages of IPM have been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
