<p>Termites are nasty clients. For some tasks, pest control employees use a combination of pest management strategies, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and diseases, though disputed by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, professional users of pesticides are needed to think about the concepts of IPM before the use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of controlling pests such as insects and termites by using other organisms 8 It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, but usually also involves an active human management role.</p>
