<p>The red imported fire ant is a widely known and frustrating  pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after regular tracking suggests that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Lots of individual commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in limited areas.</p>
<p>In addition to developing clear indications that a pest control program is undoubtedly an IPM system, it is likewise essential to offer criteria to measure performance of the system. Typically between thirty minutes to 2 hours is required to carry out the general pest control treatment. Public demand is affected by retail marketing strategies, concerns for food safety based on pesticide policies in their area, and an absence of understanding on food production among other factors.</p>
