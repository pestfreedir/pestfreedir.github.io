The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Numerous individual product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted locations.</p>
<p>For instance, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more each week while a pesticide application normally requires the use of tractor once every 7-14 d. To control particular pests, multiple applications of natural pesticides may be necessary with associated threats and expenses, while comparable pest populations might be controlled by fewer chemical pesticide applications.</p>
