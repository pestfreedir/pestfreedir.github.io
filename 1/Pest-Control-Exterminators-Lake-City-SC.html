<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of ethical and reasonable factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM experts and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique is based on our four concepts that together we call ERDM. We understand that discovering pests in your home or business is stressful. Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control requires time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about minimizing pesticide use.

Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to describe an organized method of handling pests using non-chemical pest management approaches and the cautious use of pesticides when pest populations go beyond appropriate levels.</p>
