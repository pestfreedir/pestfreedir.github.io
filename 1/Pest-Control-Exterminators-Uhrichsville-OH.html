Commercial pest control companies have obligations that go far beyond that of managing and removing pests.</p>
<p>The determination of the right cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides toxic to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
