To resolve intrusive pest issues, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
