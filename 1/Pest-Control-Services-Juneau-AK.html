<p>You are safe, sure and protected with HICARE's termite pest control services. Insects are infamously difficult to control. Pests seek out locations with an abundant food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can breed. Other reasonably low-risk pesticides are readily available for some pests.

<p>Experienced field teams will be able to determine and monitor pest issues and successfully carry out the management methods. The idea of integrated pest management (IPM) stemmed almost 60 years ago in action to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Several of the resources noted at the end of this brochure can be used for identification of insect pests affecting collections.</p>
<p>The many differing risks from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is limited to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low environmental impact. Professional exterminators use various types of baits and pesticides to eliminate and eliminate pests. Reliable, long-term restorative actions can then be taken to prevent pests from going into the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
