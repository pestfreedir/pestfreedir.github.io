<p>As the federal authority under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), the PMRA establishes pest management policies and standards; promotes sustainable pest management; seeks to improve the regulative procedure to increase performance; implements compliance with the PCPA; and, disperses pest management details to the public and crucial stakeholders.</p>
