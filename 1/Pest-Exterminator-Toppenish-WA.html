<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your center currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact products and services.</p>
<p>Monitoring and identification lowers the dangers of utilizing the incorrect type of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other methods will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control method is that it's considered to be eco-friendly, it's odor free and does not leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned. Cultural practices - depend on a method to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or place by both adults and immatures.</p>
<p>The lots of varying risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
<p>Other approaches include hand picking of pests, sticky boards or tapes for control of flying insects in greenhouses and various trapping methods. IPM takes advantage of all proper pest management options consisting of, but not restricted to, the sensible use of pesticides.
