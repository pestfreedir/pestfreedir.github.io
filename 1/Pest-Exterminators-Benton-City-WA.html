<p>Based on the records on using pesticides and on the monitoring of damaging organisms the expert user ought to inspect the success of the applied plant defense steps. For example, sun-loving plants are more vulnerable to pests and other issues when planted in shady areas, and vice versa. 3. Biological controls such as picking competitive, preferable plants that make it difficult for weeds to grow, or drawing in beneficial insects to control insect pests.</p>
<p>If you ever see pests returning after treatment, Stay vigilant and call your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment. Modern crop ranges typically unintentionally produce conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest species which have actually bored deeper into bigger fruit making them unattainable to natural opponents).
