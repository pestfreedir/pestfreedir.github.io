<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and have a lot of the ecological and human safety threats as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally taking place compounds (e.g.-- nicotine, bug and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active component might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability.
