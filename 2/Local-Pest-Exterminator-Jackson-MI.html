<p>These unknown or poorly understood prospective hazards argue for additional levels of protection consisting of direct exposures to several pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet plan; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and personal care products; and the general difficulty in associating chronic health problems to any one particular cause.</p>

<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and reduce threat from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a manner that lessens total financial, health, and environmental dangers.</p>
<p>Current studies document the need for continued reductions in harmful pesticide usage and practices.
