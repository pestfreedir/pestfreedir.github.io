<p>A specific pest can be controlled by specific options, but they may not all be readily available in a specific location, for a particular crop, or within the readily available financial methods. IPM includes using the very best combination of cultural, biological and chemical steps for particular situations, including plant biotechnology as suitable. This planning includes attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest problems may be, picking crop ranges which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, selecting tillage systems that will reduce anticipated pest damage while providing the crop the best yield potential.</p>
