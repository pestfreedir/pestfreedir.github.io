<h3>Winter Pest Control Tips Bryant AR</h3>
<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a duration of about ten years, primarily amongst researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are typically monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which creates a homogenous habitat frequently lacking crucial requirements of natural enemies, thus favoring pest species.</p>

Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
