<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a combination of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to weeds, illness, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dose when other techniques of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
