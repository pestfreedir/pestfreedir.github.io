<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of reasonable and moral considerations were found to the motorists in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
