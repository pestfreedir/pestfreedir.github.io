<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very effective in triggering significant decreases in pest populations in particular situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

<p>In the pest control stories, the kids learned that farmers utilize ladybirds to eliminate aphids on their crops, and that a big weed-eating undersea mammal (the manatee) is utilized by river authorities to keep waterways clear for boats. When it is actually needed, specification of infested locations and differentiated application of plant security products reduce the damage for human beings and nature as chemicals are used only.</p>
