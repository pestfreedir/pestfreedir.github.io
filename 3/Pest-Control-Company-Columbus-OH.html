	<meta name="description" content="Mice Pest Control in Columbus OH - Significant improvement of cat dermal lesions (SCORFAD) from baseline was observed in both fluralaner and selamectin treatment groups, however, this was achieved sooner (30 days post-treatment) in fluralaner-treated cats compared to selamectin-treated cats (60 days) although treatment groups were not significantly different (Table 5 ). Owner assessed pruritus severity was significantly reduced from baseline on all post-treatment collection days for both treatments, and fluralaner-treated cats had significantly less severe pruritus than selamectin treated cats on days 21 and 28-30 (Table 4 ). Improvement in owner-assessed pruritus correlates with reductions in flea numbers and is consistent with a reduction in flea bites.">
