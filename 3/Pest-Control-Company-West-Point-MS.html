<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very effective in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or saving natural enemy populations by providing havens or preventing practices that harm them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is likewise based on semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are repelled or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide problems are triggered by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
