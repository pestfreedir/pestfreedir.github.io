<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

Standards and legislation relating to the use, allowed approaches of application and the storage conditions of chemicals and pesticides vary from nation to country, frequently being legislated by each state of area.
