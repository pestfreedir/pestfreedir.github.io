Since they escape regular control by natural managing agents, frequently organisms rise to pest status.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest determination include intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
