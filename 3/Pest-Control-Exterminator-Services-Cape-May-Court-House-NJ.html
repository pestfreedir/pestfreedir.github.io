<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in a natural system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators have to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the specialists.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>This info, in combination with readily available pest control approaches, is used to handle pest damage by the most affordable ways, and with the least possible threat to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are always the last hope in an IPM program. This is gone over in Chapter 16. Modifications in cultural, farming, and financial patterns throughout the world have had an extensive result on insect-pest management and control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies many of the same ideas as IPM however limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
