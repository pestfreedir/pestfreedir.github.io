<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about lowering pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply picked biopesticides with low environmental impact. Expert exterminators utilize different kinds of baits and pesticides to eliminate and get rid of pests.

In an agricultural crop, this may suggest using cultural methods, such as rotating between different crops, picking pest-resistant ranges, and planting pest-free rootstock.
