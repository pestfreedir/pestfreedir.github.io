<p>The technique to be chosen for IPM depends upon lots of aspects, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests cause substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been effectively utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
