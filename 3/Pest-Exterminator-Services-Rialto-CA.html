<p>Below ground termites are the most devastating termites in the United States. Diseases or pests can be present in a crop without triggering financial damage. Precision applications of low toxicity pesticides instead of common baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have actually proven to significantly minimize the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests often have natural enemies that are beneficial to the landscape.</p>
<p>Some also recognized that if regionally coordinated IPM might happen, even yearly management of a constant pest might be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who focus on commercial or commercial pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the foundation for establishment of effective and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
