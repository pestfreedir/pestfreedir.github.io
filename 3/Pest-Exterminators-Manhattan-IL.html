<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life stages.</p>

Tolerance of pests differs according to the health danger (low tolerance) or merely a cosmetic damage (high tolerance in a non-commercial circumstance).</p>
<p>They are chosen and applied in a method that prevents disrupting other IPM practices if pesticides are needed. Nearly every type of pest presents a threat to the properties they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the implementation of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>This in turn avoids weak plants which are more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Pest control procedures might be carried out as part of an integrated pest management technique. Lots of nations have phased out broad-spectrum pesticides and fumigants. Applicators use a wider range of pesticides and handle more major pests such as termites, in addition to fumigating houses to deal with large-scale problems.</p>
