<p>There are 2 various kinds of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest facility, recreation, dispersal, and survival. Growers in Bangladesh, Haiti, Moldova, and Myanmar, during training programs arranged by the U.S. Firm for International Advancement, shared that natural farming is more difficult than conventional farming specifically for pest management, however they produce organically because of high returns (individual communication).</p>
<p>This info, in mix with available pest control techniques, is utilized to manage pest damage by the most economical means, and with the least possible risk to individuals, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are always the last option in an IPM program. This is discussed in Chapter 16.
